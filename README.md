## Project Instruction

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
The program prompts the user to input marks.Then output the correct grade as follows;

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
Marks below 0 and above 100 returns invalid marks.


Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
The program prompts  the user to input their car speed. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
